#### Notes about this project
I learned a couple of things doing this project.

1. I hate websites that have you sign in, but then when you go back to the home page, there's a log in button again as if you didn't already log in. I now understand why that  is, as it happened to me several times.

2. I used <span> tags in this project, in contract to the first project.

### Improvements that could be made
...DON'T expand the screen more than 1000px. Thanks. :)

....Also, I want to not do the lines option, instead have a <textarea> that parses the data into an array.

## Technologies
1. Node.js
2. MongoDB/Mongoose
3. EJS/JavaScript
4. HTML/CSS
